	<p><img class="image-right" src="images/460x290/alpha.png" alt="" /> Historically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the Old Italic alphabets of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic family in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include Raetic, Etruscan, or Old Latin as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy, which would become characteristic of the runes.</p>
	<p>The process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and Northern Germany, not near Italy. A "West Germanic hypothesis" suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups, while a "Gothic hypothesis" presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion.</p>

	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Elder Futhark</a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		 <div class="content"><p>Elder Futhark is thought to be the oldest version of the Runic alphabet, and was used in the parts of Europe which were home to Germanic peoples, including Scandinavia. Other versions probably developed from it. The names of the letters are shown in Common Germanic, the reconstructed ancestor of all Germanic languages.</p></div>

	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Gothic Runes</a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		 <div class="content"><p>Gothic, an extinct East Germanic language, was originally written with a Runic alphabet about which little is known. One theory of the origins of runes is that they were invented by the Goths, but this is impossible to prove as very few inscriptions of writing in Gothic runes survive. These runes were replaced with a new alphabet in the 4th century AD.</p></div>

	<!-- Accordion #3 -->
	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Younger Futhork </a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		<div class="content"><p>Younger Futhork or "Normal Runes" gradually evolved Elder Futhark over a period of many years and stabilized by about 800 A.D., the beginning of the Viking Age. It was the main alphabet in Norway, Sweden and Denmark throughout the Viking Age, but was largely though not completely replaced by the Latin alphabet by about 1200 as a result of the conversion of most of Scandinavia to Christianity.</p></div>
	</div>

		<!-- Accordion #4 -->
	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Dalecarlian Runes</a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		<div class="content"><p>Dalecarlian runes were a runic alphabet used in the Swedish province of Dalarna/Dalecarlia until the early 20th century, mainly to write the Elfdalian language. They developed from Younger Futhork during the 16th century and other time became increasingly mixed with letters from the Latin alphabet. This alphabet is also known as Elfdalian runes or dalrunes.</p></div>
		<div class="content"><p>This alphabet was mainly inscribed into wood and stone on furniture, buildings, bowls, measuring sticks, etc. to write the names of the owners and/or makings. The earliest known inscription in Daelcarlian runes, for example, appears on a bowl from Åsen, a village in Älvdalen parish, and says "Anders has made (this) bowl anno 1596".</p></div>

	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Székely-Hungarian Rovás (Hungarian Runes)</a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		<div class="content"><p>Székely-Hungarian Rovás, which are also known as Hungarian Runes, are thought to have descended from the Turkic script (Kök Turki) used in Central Asia, though some scholars believe the Székely-Hungarian Rovás pre-date the Turkic script. They were used by the Székler Magyars in Hungary until the 11th century. In remote parts of Transylvania however, the runes were still used up until the 1850s. During the 20th century there was a revival of interest in the alphabet.</p></div>

		<!-- Accordion #6 -->
	<span class="acc-trigger"><a href="#">Turkic (Orkhon) Runes</a></span>
	<div class="acc-container">
		<div class="content"><p>The earliest known examples of writing in any Turkic language were found in the Orkhon river valley in Mongolia in the 19th century. They date from the early 8th century AD and the script in which they are written is known as the Orkhon alphabet, or the Old Turkic script, the Göktürk script, or the Orkhon-Yenisey script. Inscriptions dating from the later 8th century AD in a slight variant of the Orkhon alphabet, known as Yenisei or Siberian runes, have also been found around Yenisei and other parts of Siberia.</p></div>

	<div class="acc-container">
		<div class="content"><p>J.R.R. Tolkien created many languages throughout his life. He wrote in one of his letters that the tales of Middle-earth (The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarilion) grew from these languages, rather than the languages being created for use in the stories.</p></div>
		<div class="content"><p>Tolkien also created a number of different alphabets to write his languages - he modeled Cirth on Anglo-Saxon and Norse Runes. Its function in his stories is for inscriptions in wood and stone, just as Runes were used in the real world.</p></div>
